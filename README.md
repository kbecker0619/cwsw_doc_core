# cwsw_lib_core
## Base-level (foundational) Subcomponent for CWSW's library suite

The Library component is designed to be placed at the Services level, and is designed to provide core, stateless, utility functions.

This repo implements the core sources for the component, and is intended to be inserted as a submodule in the parent project's sources folder tree.
